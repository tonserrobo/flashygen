I apologize, but the content you provided appears to be incomplete or insufficient for creating flashcards. The input contains only a YouTube video link and a text fragment that doesn't provide substantial information about adding armature to characters or any specific technical details.

To create meaningful flashcards, I would need:
1. The actual content from the Notion page
2. Specific details about character armature
3. Technical instructions or common errors related to armature creation

If you'd like me to create flashcards, please provide the full text content from your Notion page. Without the source material, I cannot generate the requested JSON flashcard array.

Would you like to paste the complete content from your Notion page?
