    "back": "The `git commit -m` command is used to create a new commit in the Git repository with a provided commit message.\n\nThe `-m` option allows you to specify the commit message directly on the command line, rather than opening a text editor to write the message.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash
git commit -m "Merge feature-login: Resolve authentication conflicts"
```\n\nThis creates a new commit with the provided message, capturing the current state of the repository. The commit message should be a brief, meaningful description of the changes included in the commit.",

    "front": "Why is it important to provide a clear and descriptive commit message when merging?",
    "back": "Providing a clear and descriptive commit message when merging is important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Collaboration and Understanding**: The commit message helps other developers understand the context and reasoning behind the merge, making it easier to collaborate and maintain the codebase.\n\n2. **Code Review and Debugging**: The commit message provides valuable information for code reviewers and future developers who may need to debug or investigate the changes made during the merge.\n\n3. **Version Control and History**: The commit message becomes part of the repository's history, providing a detailed record of the changes and the rationale behind them.\n\nIn the example, the commit message \"Merge feature-login: Resolve authentication conflicts\" clearly explains that the merge resolves authentication conflicts between the main branch and the feature-login branch. This helps other team members understand the context and purpose of the merge.",

    "front": "When would you use the git commit -m command to merge changes?",
    "back": "You would typically use the `git commit -m` command to merge changes when:\n\n1. **Resolving Conflicts**: After resolving conflicts during a merge, you would use `git commit -m` to create a new commit that incorporates the resolved conflicts.\n\n2. **Merging Feature Branches**: When merging a feature branch back into the main branch, you would use `git commit -m` to create a new commit that captures the merged changes.\n\n3. **Squashing Commits**: During a merge, you may want to squash multiple commits into a single commit, in which case you would use `git commit -m` to create the final, squashed commit.\n\n4. **Merging with a Fast-forward**: In some cases, a merge can be performed with a fast-forward, where no new commit is created. In this scenario, you would still use `git commit -m` to create the merge commit.\n\nThe example given, `git commit -m "Merge feature-login: Resolve authentication conflicts"`, is a common use case where the `git commit -m` command is used to create a merge commit that resolves authentication conflicts between the main branch and a feature branch.",

    "front": "How does the git commit -m command differ from a regular git commit?",
    "back": "The main difference between `git commit -m` and a regular `git commit` command is the way the commit message is provided:\n\n**`git commit -m`:**\n- The commit message is specified directly on the command line using the `-m` option.\n- This is a more concise way to create a commit and is useful for simple, one-line commit messages.\n\n**Regular `git commit`:**\n- The commit message is entered in a text editor, which opens after running the `git commit` command.\n- This allows for more detailed, multi-line commit messages and provides more flexibility for the commit message content.\n\nBoth commands create a new commit in the Git repository, but the `git commit -m` approach is more suitable for simple, straightforward commit messages, while the regular `git commit` is better for more complex or longer commit messages that require more detailed explanation.",

    "front": "How do you merge feature branches using the git commit -m command?",
    "back": "To merge a feature branch using the `git commit -m` command, follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure you are on the main or target branch where you want to merge the changes:\n\n```bash
git checkout main
```\n\n2. Merge the feature branch into the current branch:\n\n```bash
git merge feature-login -m "Merge feature-login: Resolve authentication conflicts"
```\n\nThis will:\n\n- Merge the `feature-login` branch into the current branch (assumed to be `main`)\n- Create a new merge commit with the provided message `"Merge feature-login: Resolve authentication conflicts"`\n\nIf there are any conflicts that need to be resolved, you would do so before running the `git commit -m` command to create the final merge commit.",
